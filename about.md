## RM Software Services Ltd

My name is Richard Moulton and I'm a freelance IBM i developer with over 30 
years of professional experience.

I have extensive experience in the complete development life cycle, and have
had an in-depth involvement in a vast number of projects in many industry
sectors, with roles ranging from application testing to project management.
There are few IT roles I havenâ€™t performed during my career.
